# Chilean Payroll System Mission (Lite)

Chilean Payroll System is a technical challenge API that helps developers demonstrate expertise in complex payroll calculations by providing accurate Chilean labor law compliance and tax computation capabilities.

This Rails 8.0 API serves as a comprehensive technical assessment tool for developers working on financial systems, showcasing proper implementation of Chilean tax brackets, AFP contributions, and health insurance deductions. Unlike generic payroll examples, it provides production-ready architecture with layered design patterns, value objects, and comprehensive Chilean regulatory compliance.
