## 2025-08-10: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build a comprehensive Chilean Payroll Liquidation System as a Ruby on Rails 8.0 API-only application that demonstrates expertise in complex financial calculations, Chilean labor law compliance, and clean architecture patterns for technical assessment purposes.

### Context

This is a technical challenge project designed to showcase developer capabilities in handling complex business logic, regulatory compliance, and modern Rails architecture. The system must accurately implement Chilean payroll regulations including progressive tax calculations, AFP contributions, health insurance deductions, and legal gratifications while demonstrating clean code principles and production-ready patterns.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Simple CRUD Payroll System**
   - Pros: Faster to implement, straightforward data modeling
   - Cons: Doesn't demonstrate complex business logic skills, lacks regulatory compliance depth

2. **Generic International Payroll System**
   - Pros: Broader applicability, simpler tax rules
   - Cons: Doesn't showcase knowledge of specific regulatory environments, less technical complexity

3. **Full-Stack Application with UI**
   - Pros: Demonstrates full-stack capabilities, better user experience
   - Cons: Divides focus between frontend and backend complexity, longer development time

### Rationale

Chose Chilean-specific API-only implementation because:
- Demonstrates deep understanding of complex business rules and regulatory compliance
- API-only design showcases backend architecture skills without frontend distractions
- Chilean payroll complexity (progressive taxes, AFP, health insurance) provides rich technical challenges
- Clean architecture patterns (Value Objects, Strategy Pattern, Layered Design) show advanced Rails skills
- Production-ready tooling (Brakeman, RuboCop, Docker) demonstrates professional development practices

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear demonstration of complex business logic implementation skills
- Comprehensive showcase of Rails 8.0 modern patterns and architecture
- Strong foundation for financial system development assessment
- Reusable patterns for other regulatory compliance projects

**Negative:**
- Higher initial complexity requiring deep understanding of Chilean labor law
- API-only limits visual demonstration of functionality
- Specific to Chilean market, limiting broader applicability
- Requires extensive testing to ensure calculation accuracy

## 2025-08-10: Architecture Pattern Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement a **Layered Design architecture** extending Rails MVC with **Value Objects** for domain entities and the **Strategy Pattern** for calculation logic, moving beyond Rails' default Active Record-based approach.

### Context

While Rails provides a solid MVC foundation, complex financial calculations and regulatory compliance require more sophisticated architectural patterns to maintain code quality, testability, and extensibility as the system grows.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Standard Rails MVC with Active Record**
   - Pros: Familiar, fast to implement, Rails conventions
   - Cons: Business logic mixed with persistence, harder to test complex calculations, poor separation of concerns

2. **Service Objects Only**
   - Pros: Better separation than pure MVC, easier testing
   - Cons: Can become procedural, doesn't address data modeling issues

3. **Full DDD with Aggregates/Entities**
   - Pros: Maximum separation, excellent for complex domains
   - Cons: Over-engineering for this scope, high learning curve

### Rationale

**Layered Design** provides:
- Clear separation between presentation (controllers), business logic (services/calculators), and data access
- Natural organization for complex payroll calculation workflows
- Easier testing of business rules in isolation

**Value Objects** provide:
- Immutable domain entities (Employee, Payroll, Deduction) instead of primitive hashes
- Built-in validation and business rules
- Better API design and type safety

**Strategy Pattern** provides:
- Pluggable calculation algorithms (different tax brackets, AFP providers, health plans)
- Easy testing of calculation logic variations
- Clean extension points for new requirements

### Implementation Guidelines

```ruby
# Layered Design Structure
app/
├── controllers/           # Presentation layer
├── services/             # Application services
├── calculators/          # Business logic layer
├── value_objects/        # Domain entities
├── strategies/           # Calculation strategies
└── models/               # Data access layer

# Value Object Example
class Employee < ValueObject
  attribute :rut, RUT
  attribute :salary, Money
  attribute :health_plan, HealthPlan
end

# Strategy Example  
class TaxCalculator
  def initialize(strategy: ProgressiveTaxStrategy.new)
    @strategy = strategy
  end
  
  def calculate(taxable_income)
    @strategy.calculate(taxable_income)
  end
end
```

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Cleaner separation of concerns beyond standard Rails patterns
- Better testability for complex business logic
- Professional demonstration of architectural knowledge
- Easier maintenance and extension of calculation rules

**Negative:**
- More files and classes than standard Rails approach
- Requires additional setup and understanding of patterns
- May seem over-engineered for simpler use cases
