## 2025-08-10: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build a comprehensive Chilean Payroll Liquidation System as a Ruby on Rails 8.0 API-only application that demonstrates expertise in complex financial calculations, Chilean labor law compliance, and clean architecture patterns for technical assessment purposes.

### Context

This is a technical challenge project designed to showcase developer capabilities in handling complex business logic, regulatory compliance, and modern Rails architecture. The system must accurately implement Chilean payroll regulations including progressive tax calculations, AFP contributions, health insurance deductions, and legal gratifications while demonstrating clean code principles and production-ready patterns.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Simple CRUD Payroll System**
   - Pros: Faster to implement, straightforward data modeling
   - Cons: Doesn't demonstrate complex business logic skills, lacks regulatory compliance depth

2. **Generic International Payroll System**
   - Pros: Broader applicability, simpler tax rules
   - Cons: Doesn't showcase knowledge of specific regulatory environments, less technical complexity

3. **Full-Stack Application with UI**
   - Pros: Demonstrates full-stack capabilities, better user experience
   - Cons: Divides focus between frontend and backend complexity, longer development time

### Rationale

Chose Chilean-specific API-only implementation because:
- Demonstrates deep understanding of complex business rules and regulatory compliance
- API-only design showcases backend architecture skills without frontend distractions
- Chilean payroll complexity (progressive taxes, AFP, health insurance) provides rich technical challenges
- Clean architecture patterns (Value Objects, Strategy Pattern, Layered Design) show advanced Rails skills
- Production-ready tooling (Brakeman, RuboCop, Docker) demonstrates professional development practices

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear demonstration of complex business logic implementation skills
- Comprehensive showcase of Rails 8.0 modern patterns and architecture
- Strong foundation for financial system development assessment
- Reusable patterns for other regulatory compliance projects

**Negative:**
- Higher initial complexity requiring deep understanding of Chilean labor law
- API-only limits visual demonstration of functionality
- Specific to Chilean market, limiting broader applicability
- Requires extensive testing to ensure calculation accuracy
